# gh-actions-samples

The purpose of this repo is to create examples of github actions and have anyone test the actions by creating an issue that matches the action's file name.

Each action will detect when an issue was created by listening for the [`issues`](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows#issues-event-issues) event.

Will add more information later...
